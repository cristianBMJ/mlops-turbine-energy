# Machine Learning Model to Predict Turbine Energy Yield (TEY)

This prototype predicts Turbine Energy Yield (TEY) using a machine learning model. It consists of an interactive Streamlit application that makes predictions using an API, which serves the best model obtained from experiments in MLflow.

##  Prerequisite

### Install Poetry

If you haven't installed Poetry yet, you can do so by running:

    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

Navigate to the project directory where the `pyproject.toml` file is located and run:

    poetry install 

Ensure that you are using a compatible Python version `>=3.9 and <4.0` except `3.9.7`. You can check your Python version with:


    python --version

## Installation

### Clone the Repository 

    git clone https://github.com/cristianBMJ/mlops-turbine-energy.git
    cd <repository_directory>



## Usage 

### Run MLflow

To start the MLflow UI to make experiments, run the following command:

    mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --port 5000

Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

Training a new experiment:

    python src/model_training

### Run API app

    python api/app.py 

Running on http://127.0.0.1:5001


### Run Streamlit app


After installing the dependencies, trained an experiment in MLflow,
log the best model, and serve it through the Flask API before launching 
the Streamlit app.

       streamlit run streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to access the Streamlit application.

## Troubleshooting

### - Streamlit/python Version Mismatch `3.9.7`

*Solution:*

- Install a compatible version `3.9.8` using pyenv
- Reinstall all dependecies with Poetry
- Add Streamlit with Poetry
